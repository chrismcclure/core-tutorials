Taking some notes along the way

1) When you run docker commands, make sure you are in the directory with the docker file.  While that seems silly, it's easy to mess up
2) docker build -t weatherapi .   TODO a build with docker
3) docker run weatherapi  TO run the container
4) docker run -p 8080:80 weatherapi  TO exposed port 8080 and map to 80 inside the container
5) docker ps  TO get running container
6) docker container prune  To remove all the containers


User Secrets
1) Make sure the csporj has something like this:     <UserSecretsId>7a387871-7cfb-450b-ae78-cce3b836b68f</UserSecretsId>
1) dotnet user-secrets set "Kestrel:Certificates:Development:Password" "Penlink123"  How to do secrets

2) dotnet dev-certs https --trust   TO trust the cert
